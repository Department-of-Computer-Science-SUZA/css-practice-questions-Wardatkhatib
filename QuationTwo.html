    <p>Coffee is a brewed drink with a distinct aroma and flavor, prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds found inside<br> "berries" of the Coffea plant. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in equatorial Latin America,<br> Southeast Asia, India and Africa. The two most commonly grown are the highly regarded arabica, and the less <br> sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. The latter is resistant to the coffee leaf rust, Hemileia vastatrix,<br> but has a more bitter taste. Once ripe, coffee beans are picked, processed, and dried. Green (unroasted) coffee beans<br> Gare one of the most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Once traded, the beans are roasted to varying<br> degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee. Coffee is slightly acidic and can have a<br> stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and<br> presented in a variety of ways. The effect of coffee human health has been a subject of many studies; however, results have<br> varied in terms of coffee's relative benefit. The majority of recent research suggests that moderate coffee consumption is benign<br> or mildly beneficial in healthy adults. However, the diterpenes in coffee may increase the risk of heart disease.</p>
